# login_reset

This repo implements a login page & password reset with php and bootstrap.  The "Account Setting" link in the navbar is also functional.  Users will be able to change their own passwords (provided their current password matches the user's password in a PostgreSQL database on the backend, and their new password choice meets certain criteria).
